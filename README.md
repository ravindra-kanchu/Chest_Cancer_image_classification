# Lung Cancer Classification

This project aims to classify lung cancer images into three categories: benign, normal, or malignant. It uses deep learning techniques to analyze and predict the category based on the input images.

## Features

- Classification of lung cancer images into benign, normal, or malignant categories.
- Utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification.
- High accuracy in detecting and classifying lung cancer images.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the IQ-OTH/NCCD Lung Cancer Dataset, available on Kaggle. It includes labeled lung cancer images categorized into three classes: benign cases, malignant cases, and normal cases.

### Classes:
- **Benign Cases**: Images of benign lung tumors.
- **Malignant Cases**: Images of malignant lung tumors.
- **Normal Cases**: Images of healthy lung tissue.

## Model

The classification model is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, specifically designed for image classification tasks. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of lung cancer images.
By applying pretrained models the model performance is incerase
